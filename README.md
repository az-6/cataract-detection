### About
Our Application can detect early Cataract disease by using an image that is predicted by a Convolutional Neural Network Deep Learning Model that can give an output if the image that the user input is classified has Cataract disease or not. We use data from [Kaggle Cataract Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandanp6/cataract-image-dataset) to train our model.
### Tutorial
Inside each folder path we have created a documentation on how you can replicate our steps
