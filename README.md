### About
Our Application can detect early Cataract disease by using an image that is predicted by a Convolutional Neural Network Deep Learning Model that can give an output if the image that the user input is classified has Cataract disease or not. We use data from [Kaggle Cataract Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandanp6/cataract-image-dataset) to train our model.
### Tutorial
1. Prepare an eye image that is going to be predicted, make sure it's in high resolution.
2. Click "Choose file" on our application, and insert the eye image file.
3. Click "Detect" after the image is inserted.
4. The result can be seen on "Condition" that tells if the image is classified as a cataract or not, and "Prediction score" to shows the accuracy that our model predict.
